			<h1>The Middle </h1>
			<p>One day after school she saw a sign up paper for a school talent show. but when she went to go sign up she got pushed away by one biggger girl, she was the most popular girl in her grade, she also had a group of at least 4 or 5 other girls crowad around here, the bigger girl laugh and told her that she shouldn't even bother sign she was ever a good dancer. the girled got up and ran off crying.The next day the girl went back in scetrecy and signed up for the talent show. and after school she went straight home and practiced her heart  and feet until she could do no more. for 1 whole week she practiced day and night, everywhere she went she practied. </p>

			<h1>The End </h1>
			<p>Then a week passed and it was time she was so nerves about the whole talent show. she was worried she won't be worth enought to dance in front of her whole claas but the whole school. her turn was coming up and the nerves were kicking, then by surpied her father came back staged and told her it doesn't matter if you mess up as long as you have fun and enjoy you'll do amazing. So when she got a stage she dance like nobody was watching, the dance was wonderful, fun and creative </p>
